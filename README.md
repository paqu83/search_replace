#Search and Replace Module

###If you would like to search and replace specific string in all your content entities without messing with your MySQL database please find this tool.

Please use with caution!
 
Go to the `/admin/search_replace` to start using this module.  
All "classic" content entities (including ECK's) are currently supported.

Please keep in mind when using automatic replace, **do not replace for an empty string**  
use some custom dummy one. This way you can always undo the operation.

#Never run on prod without testing it locally and backing up the database before
